Hi team,

This is the DarkTheme I have created by updating the selivered Fusion Blue Jar and got the below color scheme for the SQL Developer.

Installation:

1. Download the fusionblue.jar
2. Navigate to SQlDeveloper Directory then IDE and themes
3. Have a backup of fusionblue.jar
4. Copy the downloaded the fusionblue.jar to the themes folder.
5. Restart the SQL Developer IDE to get the color scheme applied.
